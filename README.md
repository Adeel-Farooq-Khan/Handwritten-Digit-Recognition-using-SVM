# SVM Digit Recognition

This repository contains the code and resources for the **SVM Digit Recognition** project, part of my 30-Day AI Project Series. The project demonstrates how to use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Support Vector Machines are a powerful machine learning tool, especially for classification tasks. In this project, I used SVMs to create a model that can accurately classify digits from 0 to 9. The project includes the following steps:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Loading and normalizing the MNIST dataset.
- **Model Training:** Training the SVM model using different kernels (linear, RBF, etc.).
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model‚Äôs performance on the test set.
- **Visualization:** Visualizing some of the test set predictions.

## üîß Installation

To run the code, you‚Äôll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
